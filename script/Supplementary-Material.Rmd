## SM S1: The formation of the cave and its stratigraphic sequence
Fumane Cave is located on a rock cliff approximately 350 meters above sea level in the western Monti Lessini Plateau within the Venetian pre-Alps of northeastern Italy (see **Fig. 1a**). The initial scientific exploration of the site took place in 1964, followed by excavations conducted by the Natural History Museum of Verona in 1982, focusing on the lowermost deposits exposed during road construction. After a period of inactivity, during which unauthorized excavations caused damage to the southeastern deposits, systematic fieldwork resumed in 1988 under the coordination of the University of Ferrara. Excavations continue today under the direction of one of us (MP).

Fumane is part of a karst complex formed during the Neogene, carved into the Ooliti di San Virgilio—a sequence of thick carbonate sandstone layers with distinctive cross-lamination, cyclically interspersed with micritic limestones. The karst complex consists of a wide opening partially filled with residual dolomite sands, featuring a main cavity (Tunnel B) and two associated tunnels (A and C) that open at the upper section (see **Fig. 1b**). Tunnel C and part of Tunnel B are excavated within the micritic layers, while Tunnel A and the western portion of Tunnel B extend into the carbonate sandstones. These lithological units, extensively dolomitized, are separated by a distinct discontinuity that runs through Tunnel B, significantly influencing the composition of the Stratigraphic Units (SUs). The ceiling of the carbonate sandstone unit has been unstable due to fractures parallel to the overlying rock wall, leading to landslides at the cave entrance. These collapses and sediment buildup eventually prevented access to the cave after the Heinrich Event 3. Thus, the cave’s current morphology and stratigraphic sequence result from two major processes: the collapse of thick calcarenites and the gradual dismantling of micritic banks at the entrance, primarily driven by freeze-thaw cycles during the Late Pleistocene (Broglio & Dalmeri, 2005; Peresani, 2022).

The sequence of archaeological SUs at Fumane is notably complex, characterized by lateral variations in sediment composition between the cave's interior and exterior, as well as between its western and eastern sides. This variability is primarily due to the abrupt transition between the calcarenite and micrite layers, running roughly transverse to the cave's main axis. Surface dissolution of carbonate sandstones led to sand accumulation in the western side of the cave. At the same time, the fragmentation of micrite banks deposited angular rubble with varying sandy-loamy matrices in the central and eastern sectors. This distinction is evident in both Middle and Upper Paleolithic SUs, reflecting climatic instability and differential rates of wall degradation.

During the early systematic excavations, researchers focused on the upper deposits in the cave exterior, revealing traces of recent landslides and some Upper Paleolithic artifacts. As large boulders were cleared, excavation shifted to the cave interior, thus identifying three primary areas: the cave exterior, characterized by boulder accumulation and silicate silt deposition with quartz and mica; the cave drip line; and the cave interior. The cave interior, with varying micro-scale temperature and humidity, has undergone post-depositional deformations, especially in the eastern zone.

The high-resolution stratigraphic sequence of Fumane (see **Fig. 1c,d**) includes several Middle and Upper Paleolithic SUs, spanning from MIS4 to H3 when the cave ceiling collapsed (Peresani, 2022, and references therein). The most anthropogenically influenced sedimentary body, named macro-unit A, contains multiple thin parallel layers and lenses, including Mousterian (A11–A4), Uluzzian (A3), and Protoaurignacian (A2–A1) occupation floors (e.g., Delpiano & Peresani, 2017; Falcucci & Peresani, 2019; Falcucci et al., 2020; Peresani, 2012; Peresani et al., 2016). Aurignacian assemblages are also found in the lower SUs of the overlying macro-unit D. This sedimentary body is marked by a marked lithological shift and evidence of multiple landslides. The harsh climatic conditions documented in macro-unit D, corroborated by small mammal assemblage studies (López-García et al., 2015), contributed to the systematic collapse of the cave ceiling, eventually sealing its entrance. Landslides alternated with aeolian and colluvial sedimentation and pedogenic processes. Human occupation becomes sporadic in the middle of this macro-unit, associated with the early Gravettian (D1d; Falcucci & Peresani, 2019), and nearly absent in the uppermost SUs. The chronological range of Aurignacian and Gravettian SUs (Falcucci & Peresani, 2019; Higham et al., 2009; Higham, 2011; Marín-Arroyo et al., 2023) places human activity between GS-10 (Rasmussen et al., 2014) and Heinrich Event 3 (Hemming, 2004).

## SM S2: Field description of stratigraphic units A2 to D1f
This section provides a detailed description of the SUs studied in the paper. Information has been summarized from the notebooks of all excavation seasons that involved the Upper Paleolithic sequence, starting with the lowermost Protoaurignacian SU A2 and ending with the almost sterile SU D1f. Photographs taken during fieldwork complement and visually enhance the written descriptions (**Figs. S1–S13**).

### A2
A2 contains one of Europe’s most renowned Protoaurignacian assemblages, dating to approximately 41.2–40.4 ky cal BP (Higham et al., 2009; Higham, 2011). It is a continuous, horizontally bedded SU with a distinct dark brown hue (Munsell Soil Color code: 10YR3/2), rich in charcoal, bones, lithics, and dwelling features. Spanning the entire cave floor, A2 was excavated from the beginning of systematic fieldwork until 2006, with limited interventions in 2014 in the northernmost area of the cave interior, covering about 100 square meters (**Fig. S3**). The thickness of A2 varies from a few centimeters to 10 cm in the cave exterior and around the cave drip line, reaching up to 25 cm in the cave interior near the walls. The cave exterior slopes southwestward, extending beyond a ridge of stones and boulders that mark the dwelling space and a large anthropogenic feature. Most preserved anthropogenic features, including combustion features and toss-zones, are concentrated in the cave exterior and just above the drip line (**Figs. S4** and **S5**). Some features were excavated at the expense of the underlying Uluzzian (e.g., S9, S10, S18) and Mousterian SUs (e.g., S14), leading to localized sediment and artifact mixing (Falcucci et al., 2017; Peresani et al., 2016).

Recent micro-contextual analysis of anthropogenic features in the western portion of A2 revealed that only one feature can be confidently classified as a hearth (S17), while the others represent complex, multi-layered remnants of occupation horizons, partially preserved. The thickness of these features suggests they resulted from intensive, short, and repeated site use rather than prolonged occupations (Marcazzan et al., 2022). Excavators noted that certain features were deformed by the compressive action of boulders and slabs (e.g., S9 and S13), animal burrowing (e.g., S9), cryoturbation (e.g., S14, S17, S18, S21), or partial erosion by water dripping (e.g., S20). Slight cryoturbation caused an uneven microtopography within the SU and partially rearranged the original orientation of artifacts.

In the cave interior, A2 is described as a black silty-sand SU with numerous frost-shattered slabs. It does not reach the cave walls but stops a few centimeters before them, likely due to the progressive retreat of the walls, allowing for loose rubble formation and the possible infiltration of younger sediments and artifacts from overlying SUs. In cross-section, A2 exhibits a concave shape near the western cave wall (squares 117–115 and 127–125), suggesting the presence of a trampled belt along the cave’s main axis (Broglio & Dalmeri, 2005). The SU slopes at an angle of about 10°–20° toward the north in the cave exterior, increasing to 30°–40° in the northernmost interior. Artifacts and stones in this innermost sector were chaotically arranged, particularly in the eastern side and near the walls, where A2 appears rippled with stretched, discontinuous boundaries and contains uplifted artifacts, bones, and stones. SUs here are tilted and compressed, resulting in stratigraphic inversion with the Uluzzian and final Mousterian SUs. The compressive action of boulders and slabs slipping toward the northernmost cave interior due to solifluction has altered the geometric layout of A2 and the overlying SUs. Only one feature, S14 in squares 95–90, was identified in this area, an interpreted combustion feature up to 20 cm thick, showing deformation from cryoturbation. Falcucci et al. (2017) noted the presence of a few Mousterian artifacts in this area.

<br>

### A1
A1, primarily located in the cave exterior and around the drip line, is characterized by a dark brownish hue (10YR3/2) and horizontal bedding. Its thickness ranges from four to 14 cm, with the thickest sections on the southeastern side. Frost-shattered slabs become more prominent near the drip line. The upper boundary between A1 and the D3 SUs shows signs of deformation and disturbance **Fig. S6**), while the boundary between A1 and A2 is generally abrupt in the eastern cave exterior. In the southwestern area, however, the boundary between A2 and A1 was indistinct, leading to its co-excavation with the upper A2 portion. Consequently, some square meters show direct contact between A2 and the D3 SUs. Additionally, A1 sediments tended to merge with the base of SU D3d in a few square meters (e.g., 46, 56, 66, 57, and 67), mainly due to its inclination, prompting hypotheses about artifact mixing between A1 and the base of D3d during excavations.

<br>

### A2R
In the cave interior, A2 displayed a rather discontinuous character. In the eastern side, a distinctive dark reddish SU (**Fig. S7a**), dominated by frost-shattered slabs, intermingled with the darker A2 sediments, nearly replacing them. This SU, designated as A2R (“R” for red), varies in thickness from 10 to 25 cm toward the eastern cave wall. A2R is notably disturbed and undulated, occasionally showing a stratigraphic inversion with the Uluzzian SU A3, especially in square 127. Adjacent to the eastern cave wall, A2R is overlain by the Mousterian SU A5+A6, leading to an inverted stratigraphy due to the tilting and compression of the stratigraphic package. This compression has created a prominent fold, elevating A2R up to 50 cm, almost reaching the surface (**Fig. S7b**). This fold sharply demarcates the deposition of yellow sands in the western sector (SU D1c) and frost-shattered gravel in the eastern sector (SU D3+D6).

<br>

### The D3 complex in the cave exterior and around the drip line
In the cave exterior and around the drip line, SUs A2 and A1 are overlain by a detrital stratigraphic complex named D3, further subdivided into several SUs based on lithological content and archaeological evidence (see **Fig. S1**). D3 comprises sandy loamy sediments with a weak angular polyhedral structure and small frost-shattered slabs, often arranged in thin layers that typically slope inward into the cavity. Notably, the SUs within D3 do not precisely match those described in the cave interior due to changes in sediment facies, post-depositional deformations, and the thinning of the sequence. While the D3 SUs may not be as archaeologically rich as A2 and A1, they are crucial for understanding the chrono-cultural development of the Aurignacian in northeastern Italy (Falcucci et al., 2020). The D3 SUs are detailed as follows:

**D3dbase.** The lowest SU within the D3 complex, D3d base, is observed in direct contact with either A1 or A2. Its sediment composition exhibits slight differences compared to the overlying D3d. Near Tunnel A, D3d base primarily consists of sands that filled erosional structures caused by water dripping from the tunnel, at the expense of A2. In some areas, such as squares 57, 67, and 68, D3d base appears to stratigraphically complement SU A1.

**D3d.** D3d marks the first documented landslide event at Fumane Cave, characterized by a dense accumulation of boulders and angular stones, each around 10 cm in size, mixed with a sandy fine fraction (**Fig. S8**). A portion of these stones appears to be intentionally arranged in a sub-horizontal pavement, although no geoarchaeological studies have verified this interpretation (Peretto et al., 2004). D3d is thicker in the cave exterior and gradually thins inward. While its boundary with the overlying SU D3b alpha is well-defined in the southwestern area, it was inconsistently defined in the southeastern area during excavations. This SU contains accumulations of stone artifacts and bones. Notably, Falcucci et al. (2020) treated D3b alpha and D3d as a single analytical unit based on fieldwork and excavation documentation.

**D3b alpha.** D3b alpha represents the most notable evidence of human occupation within the D3 complex, and it dates to the Heinrich Event 4 (Marín-Arroyo et al., 2023). Identified as a sandy-silty dark brown SU at the base of D3b, D3b alpha was excavated mainly in the southwestern area of the cave from 1996 onward (**Fig. S9a**). Earlier excavations in the southeastern area did not identify this thin SU, potentially due to differential sediment deposition and excavation techniques, which could explain the abrupt end of the SU spatial distribution along the midline of the excavation area (Broglio et al., 2006). The careful excavation in the southwestern area of the cave and around the drip line allowed for precise documentation of this SU, potentially aided by distinct sediment composition and a higher concentration of cultural remains. Archaeological finds from D3b alpha, typically within a few centimeters of sediment, include a well-preserved anthropogenic feature in square 57 (S15), two primary lithic workshops (**Fig. S9b**), scattered bones, and a split-based antler point. Numerous artifacts (n = 352) were meticulously piece-plotted, and some debitage refits were noted (De Stefani, 2003). Excavators observed that frost activity caused minor rearrangement of artifacts near S15 and the drip line, but despite this, artifacts generally appeared in place. The SU slopes northward, with the gradient increasing toward Tunnel B. Near Tunnel A, D3b alpha shows signs of erosion from hydrological activity, with sands from the tunnel filling erosive boundaries, creating alternating sandy strips and blackish sandy-silt sediments. The outermost excavated area contains minimal archaeological material, while D3b alpha seems to extend inward.

**D3b and D3a.** During the initial excavation seasons (1989–1995), two main SUs, D3a (upper) and D3b (lower), were distinguished within the D3 complex. D3a is characterized by sandy sediments mixed with frost-shattered slabs and aeolian dust, with thickness varying from about 9 cm in the cave exterior to a few centimeters after the drip line. Due to sparse artifact content, D3a was subdivided into four sub-SUs and not systematically sieved. D3b lies beneath D3a, containing richer archaeological content, including charcoal deposits, faunal remains, and a split-based antler point (i.e., square 65) analogous to the one discovered in D3b alpha. Evidence of on-site knapping is also present, with a core showing refitted bladelets and maintenance flakes (Bertola et al., 2013). As excavations progressed inward, D3a and D3b merged and thinned, prompting collective excavation as D3a+b toward the cave interior.

<br>

### D6 and D3 in the cave interior
**D6.** North of the drip line, a distinct pocket of angular clast-supported open-work breccia was identified above SU A2 (**Fig. S10**). This SU was designated as D6 and was mostly excavated during the initial fieldwork seasons. D6 is characterized by a substantial thickness and was divided into two artificial spits: D6a (upper portion) exhibited a notable scarcity of archaeological materials; D6b (lower portion) contained a relatively high concentration of artifacts. However, in many cases, the spatial documentation of the artifacts within D6 was incomplete, likely due to an excavation strategy that focused on quickly accessing SU A2.

**D3+D6.** Initially excavated north of the drip line in the proximity of Tunnel C, this SU aimed to delineate the transition between the angular breccia of D6 and D3a+b, particularly toward the western sector of the excavation area. The sediment composition closely resembles D6, primarily consisting of open-work angular breccia with silty-sandy fine particles, and its distribution appears sporadic. As excavations moved inward, D3+D6 was used to describe a thick SU of frost-shattered slabs originating from the cave wall (**Fig. S11**). In the innermost cave areas, D3+D6 was subdivided into a lower SU (approx. 30 cm thick) and an upper SU (40–50 cm thick), extending transversely to D1c, found in the western cave. In areas like square 157, D3+D6 replaced other SUs, directly overlying the Mousterian SU A5+A6. Identifying clear separations between SUs in this area was challenging (Falcucci et al., 2017; Peresani et al., 2021).

**D3a+b, D3b alpha, and D3a+b sabbie.** In the western sector of the cave interior, SUs vary significantly in sediment composition. Following A2, a thin SU labeled D3a+b, interpreted as a continuation of D3a and D3b from the cave exterior, consists of dark-brown sandy-loamy sediment with few frost-shattered slabs (see **Fig. S2**), extending laterally to SUs D6 and D3+D6. The base (D3b alpha) is darker and richer in organic material, charcoal, and artifacts, measuring 2–3 cm in thickness (**Fig. S12**). It thins out in the innermost excavation area and, according to the excavators, correlates with D3b alpha excavated externally. Below D3a+b and D3b alpha, a yellow sandy SU, labeled D3a+b sabbie (sabbie meaning sands in Italian), likely formed from surface dissolution of local calcarenites. Its thickness varies from 1 to 15 cm, with an irregular and discontinuous surface, sometimes filling erosive depressions found in SUs A2 and A2R.

<br>

### The D1 complex
The D1 complex marks the final phase of sedimentation at Fumane Cave, ultimately sealing the cave. Covering the entire excavation area, its thickness decreases toward the cave interior, where post-depositional deformations occurred under periglacial conditions. D1 was subdivided based on lithological characteristics:

**D1c.** This lowest SU, directly in contact with D3a+b, has limited archaeological evidence within a predominantly light brown laminated sand groundmass (see **Fig. S2**). It measures approximately 25–30 cm in thickness and represents a significant rockfall event documented at the site. Field notes indicate that some of the smaller boulders show signs of inward movement due to gelifluction, deforming the underlying sediments, with stoniness increasing inward and open-work breccia near the cave wall.

**D1d.** Overlying D1c, this SU consists of sandy-loam brown sediment with mild polyhedral aggregation and frost-shattered slabs oriented toward the cave’s external margin (**Fig. S13**). Its base, around 5 cm thick, contains lithic artifacts attributed to the early Gravettian, predating Heinrich Event 3 (López-García et al., 2015). Charcoal is a significant component of this SU and forms a continuous charcoal line at its base (Falcucci & Peresani, 2019).

**D1e–D1f.** The uppermost SUs correspond to the latest rockfall event, comprising boulders and frost-shattered slabs in a brown silty-sandy matrix. Some boulders accumulated near the cave drip line, while others slid down the slope into the inner cave. The top SU, D1f, represents a rendzina soil developed on loose open-work breccia, reaching up to 12 cm thick and exposed on the cave’s surface (see **Figs. S2** and **S11**). These SUs contain few lithic artifacts but numerous herbivore bones with gnawing marks, suggesting frequent visits by carnivores during this phase.

<br>

### Summary of the main post-depositional events and agents
The formation of the Upper Paleolithic stratigraphic sequence at Fumane Cave has been influenced by various post-depositional events and disturbance agents, which have impacted the preservation of anthropogenic features. These agents can be classified into two categories: geological and biological. Geological agents have been primarily driven by the harsh climatic conditions that characterized the transition from MIS3 to the beginning of MIS2. These conditions led to periglacial activity, including frost action, which in turn resulted in the gradual collapse of the cave’s ceiling. This collapse played a major role in shaping the geological layers and their composition. Biological agents also contributed to post-depositional disturbances. Animal burrows, likely created by marmots and dormice, represent one of these agents. Additionally, human activity in the form of combustion features and trampling left their mark on the site. At a microscale, soil mesofauna, and plant roots contributed to burrowing and disturbance.

Marmot burrows were frequently identified during excavations because they were very few and isolated within the primary deposits. These burrows were often located in close proximity to anthropic features, such as S9 and S10. The result of this interaction was a mixing of sediments of different colors and, in some instances, the mixing of archaeological materials from different phases. To address this issue, archaeological materials excavated within animal burrows were typically labeled accordingly. However, in cases where smaller or less conspicuous features were involved, it was not always possible to maintain a clear separation from the surrounding archaeological SUs.

Additionally, there is some evidence of percolation and dripping of water, including snow meltwater, which may have affected the SUs (Kehl et al., in preparation). Shallow channels filled with sterile sands, particularly near Tunnel A (e.g., sq. 49–59), serve as indicators of these processes, especially when the SUs were still exposed on the surface or only partially buried.

The cave exterior was primarily affected by numerous landslide events. These events, which occurred during at least three distinct instances, resulted in the collapse of several boulders and slabs. This, coupled with erosion in the southernmost region of the excavation, likely led to the partial destruction of archaeological deposits. Some boulders even rolled toward the cave interior due to solifluction—a process driven by the alternating cycles of freezing and thawing. These displaced boulders were likely responsible for compressing and deforming the SUs, including combustion features like S10.

Conversely, the cave interior experienced multiple cryoturbation events caused by freezing and thawing activity, attributed to increased humidity in this underground environment. The effects of frost activity are evident in the undulated morphology of the SUs. It began to be recorded around the cave drip line and became more pronounced toward the northernmost area of the cave interior. These events resulted in the frequent alteration of the original arrangement of artifacts, often causing them to become tilted up and oriented vertically. In some extreme cases, localized stratigraphic inversion was observed and documented accordingly.

A noteworthy aspect of Fumane is the detailed micromorphological study that was conducted, revealing that the Middle and Upper Paleolithic sequence experienced minimal sediment reworking and maintained a high degree of stratigraphic integrity (Kehl et al., in preparation). This micromorphological analysis not only supports the field observations but also provides additional insights into the impact of post-depositional events. However, it is important to mention that the thin sections available for the Aurignacian SUs do not cover the most disturbed areas of the excavations, particularly in the cave’s most internal areas. Interestingly, the micromorphological evidence suggests that occurrences of anthropogenic sedimentation and trampling are relatively rare outside of anthropogenic features. The main diachronic changes identified in the sedimentary record appear to be linked more to fluctuations in moisture levels rather than temperature variations, as detailed in Kehl et al. (in preparation).

  **Figure S33.** Carinated cores recovered from the A2 and A1 subsets. Artifacts **a**, **b**, and **d** are further classified as *Rabot*, while **c** is identified as a carinated endscraper. The flaking surface of carinated core **b** has been partially removed due to frost action. Artifact **d** is considered a core in the initial stages of reduction. Core **a** is from A1east, **b** from A2ext, and **c** and **d** from A2int. The images are derived from the cores’ 3D mesh. Each artifact is accompanied by its ID, as listed in the dataset published in this paper and the 3D dataset published by Falcucci and Peresani (2023).
